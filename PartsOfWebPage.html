  <h2>What is a Web Site</h2>
  <p>A Web site is a collection of linked Web pages stored on a Web Server. Most Web sites have a home page that describes the information located on the Web site and provides a pace where people can start their exploration of the Web site. The pages of a good Web site are intuitively organized and have a common theme.</p>
  
  <h2>What are the Parts of a Web Page?</h2>
  <p>You can communicate your message on your Web site in a variety of ways. The following are some of the common elements that appear on Web pages.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Text</li>
    <li>Images</li>
    <li>Hyperlinks</li> 
    <li>Tables</li> 
    <li>Forms</li> 
    <li>Frames</li> 
  </ol>

    <h3>Text</h3>
    <p>Text is the simplest type of content that you can publish on the Web. HTML Editor such as Dreamweaver enables you to change the size, color and font of the text on your Web page and to organize it into paragraphs, headings and lists. Perhaps the best thing about text is the practically everyone can view it, no matter what type of Web browser or Internet connection a person may have, and it downloads very quickly.</p>
    
    <h3>Images</h3>
    <p>For your Web site, you can take photos with a digital camera, and you can scan drawings, logos, or other images for the Web by using a scanner. You can also create and edit images in a graphics program, such as Adobe Photoshop or Macramedia Fireworks, and then place them on Web pages. </p>
    
    <h3>Hyperlinks</h3>
    <p>Usually called a link, a hyperlink is text or an image that has been associated with another file. You can open the other file in a Web browser by clicking the hyperlink. Although hyperlinks usually link to other Web pages or other Web sites, they can also link to other locations on the same page or to other types of files. </p>
    
    <h3>Tables</h3>
    <p>Although tables organize information in columns and rows on your Web page, you can use them for much more than just organizing data. Tables provide one of the best ways to create complex Web designs. By turning off the borders of a table and setting it to span an entire page, you can use the table to organize the entire layout of the page. </p>
    
    <h3>Forms</h3>
    <p>Forms reverse the information flow on Web sites, thus enabling visitors to your Web site to send information back to you. With an HTML Editor such as Dreamweaver, you can create forms that include text fields, drop-down menus, radio buttons, and other elements. </p>

  
  <h3>Frames</h3>
  <p>In a framed Web site, the Web browser window is divided into several rectangular frames, and a different Web page loads into each frame. Users can scroll through content each frame independently of the content in the other frames.</p>
